# CodeJava
### Welcome to CodeJava, a collection of Java programs where I solve questions step by step, turning coding into a fun game! Here, I develop my logic skills while sharing solutions to various problems. Join me in this adventure and let's enjoy the process of learning Java together! ðŸš€  

YT01: Define a class with a menu driven code to show the following pattern [Link](https://youtu.be/A-X3WfDmPlQ?si=ac3liPei5QRTGJHK)  
-      5   
       10 15  
       20 25 30  
       35 40 45 50  
-     ######  
      &&&&&&  
      ######  
      &&&&&&   


YT02: Define a class to accept values into a 3x3 array and check if it is a special array. An array is special array, if the sum of the even elements = sum of the odd elements. [Link](https://youtu.be/VMe53D-jrLM?si=LOnNZq6BiHHssILj)      
Example: A[][]= {{4,5,6}, {5,3,2}, {4,2,5}}       
Sum of even elements = 4+6+2+4+2 = 18       
Sum of odd elements = 5+5+3+5 = 18       


YT24: Write a program to input a number and check whether it is a prime number or not. If it is not a prime number then display the next number that is prime.  
Sample Input: 14  
Sample Output: 17
